# Feedback on ViperIDE

> Instead of editing on my laptop, downloading, executing..... reset...
> In my prototyping cycle, I just develop directly on the board using ViperIDE. Out of a click I can soft-reset.
> I have a small script that via `mpremote` downloads my assets back to my computer for version control and snapshots.

---

> I'm actually using it, right now, already. I happened to have a RP2040 board right here I was just writing some micropython for.
> I think this is a good way to quick-start with the boards moreso than using the Thonny IDE. It handles the filesystem access perfectly.

---

> Thank for this little IDE, I immediately love it !

---

> This is excellent - what a superb little IDE. Blazing speed and so easy to use.
> Looking forward to file upload but in the meantime I simply create a new file and paste across so no big deal.
> Congrats and thank you!

---

> Congratulations (again:-)). And thanks.
> This is a very simple way to try out MP for WebAssembly.

---

> This is awesome. New to MicroPython but Thonny was getting difficult to use.

---

> I've just had a play with this and, just like Makecode, this should make it so much simpler for schools to use the Pico as the use of WebUSB(or WebREPL)
> combined with MicroPython means the Pico looks like a serial device, not a USB device, so ignores things like BitLocker 😃
> And no need to install Thonny, Mu, etc, which should keep our IT team happy  😉

> I've found that MicroPython on a Pico makes it appear as a serial device (whereas CP makes it appear as a USB device),
> which means, just like WebUSB on the Microbit, it bypasses BitLocker 😃
