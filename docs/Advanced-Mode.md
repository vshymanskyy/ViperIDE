# Advanced Mode

Some features that are rarely used, can be mesleading or annoying are disabled by default. You can enable them by selecting `Advanced Mode` in Settings:

- Dissector and disassembler for `.mpy` files (instead of default `hex` view)
- `sysinfo.md` - a virtual file that collects some useful info from the board
